Assignment

For your own sake, before you write any code, you should "sketch" the pseudo code and make a flowchart for how you plan to do the following alterations to the game.

- Finalize implementing the evaluation of dice roles (we have marked these places with TODO: clear
- Finalize end of game.
- There is a bug in the scorecard; fix it. (not in python version)
- Make it, so the player knows how many roles are left to them.
- This code has issues. We are not detailing those issues, but we ask you to use your best judgment to "fix" the code. The issues are not limited to bugs or poorly written code but might include missing functionality that we have come to expect.
